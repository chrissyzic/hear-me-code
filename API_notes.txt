endpoint = location(s) where data are stored
parameters = "?" in URL tells you parameters are coming next, "&" lets you add additional search parameters
key = password that lets you use the API, some people are really stingy about giving out keys

API in Python
1. use request to act like a browser
2. store info you get back
3. process, combine, and/or display it
4. profit!

Detour: Libraries/Modules
Some libraries/modules come with Python, but they don't get loaded right away - you have to import them, e.g. csv, datetime, os
SOME modules have to be installed, e.g. django, numby (for complicated math), requests (for hitting APIs)
--> easiest wat to install modules (that need installing) is by using PIP, i.e. pip install modulename
